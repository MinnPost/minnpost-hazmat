SEVEN TANK CARS CONTAINING ETHANOL DERAILED WITH ALL BUT ONE CAR LEAVING THE RAIL.  THE FINAL CAR IN THE DERAILMENT CAME TO REST IN AN UPRIGHT POSITION ON A WOOD CONSTRUCTION BRIDGE.  THE TRAIN CREW BEGAN AN INSPECTION OF THE UNDESIRED EMERGENCY.  THEY SMELLED ETHYL ALCOHOL (ETHANOL) AND CONTACTED DISPATCH AND THE LOCAL EMERGENY RESPONSE TEAM.  AS INFORMATION FROM THE SCENE WAS RELAYED THROUGH DISPATCH  FORCES WERE DISPATCHED INCLUDING  LOCAL FIRE  AMBULANCE  LAW  DM&E'S HAZ-MAT MANAGER  MINNESTOA REGIONAL HAZ-MAT RESPONSE  CONTRACT HAZ-MAT RESPONDERS  ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE ENGINEERS  AND A RE-RAILING CONTRACTOR.  INITIAL DAMAGE ASSESSMENT INDICATED AT LEAST THREE CARS LEAKING PRODUCT TO THE GROUND.  THE AREA WAS A DRY CREEK BED.  TANK CAR ACFX 200406 WAS ON ITS SIDE WITH THE FILL VALVE BROKEN AND A SMALL PUNCUTRE IN THE MAN WAY COVER.  BOTH OF THESE LEAKS WERE GIVEN A TEMPORARY REPAIR WITH PLUGS AND PLUG AND PATCH MATERIAL.  TANK CAR RTMX 30684 WAS ON ITS SIDE LEAKING A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT FROM THE MAN WAY.  BOLTS WERE TIGHTENED.  TANK CAR GATX 35196 WAS UPRIGHT ON THE TRACK STRUCTURE  AT ABOUT A 20 DEGREE ANGLE WITH A 2 INCH GASH IN THE HEAD SHELL.  PLUGS AND PLUG AND DIKE WERE APPLIED.  DURING OUR SECOND DAMAGE ASSESSMENT  TANK CAR UTLX 46755 WAS NOTED UPRIGHT ON A BRIDGE LEAKING FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.  IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED TO BE THE MAN WAY GASKET.  THE CAR WAS AT AN ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE THAT THE LEAK STOPPED ITSELF PRIOR TO SUNRISE.  EQUIPMENT AND MANPOWER WAS BROUGHT TO THE SITE THROUGOUT THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING.  THE CARS WERE MONITORED FOR FURTHER LEAKAGE  AIR MONITORING CONTINUED  AN EVACUATION OF 12 CITIZENS TOOK PLACE.  REMAINING PRODUCT WAS TRANS-LOADED TO RAILCARS.  ALL PRODUCT ON THE GROUND WAS VACUUMED AND SENT TO A DESTRUCTION FACILITY. FINAL TRANS-LOADING WAS COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 25  2006 AT 2100 HRS.  TOTAL PRODUCT SPILLED WAS 24 877 GALLONS OF WHICH 11 807 GALLONS WERE RECOVERED AND DISPOSED OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS.",

Shortly afterwards  a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train's two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07. An overpass (MN State Highway 7) which runs over and is perpendicular to the main track and siding was closed until MN DOT officials inspected this structure for damages.",

The product within escaped and ran down the track embankment onto the frozen shoreline of the Mississippi River that paralleled the main tracks at this location. The root cause of the tank's failure is under investigation via metallurgical testing and evaluation. BNSF environmental contractors initiated verification sampling of the impacted areas of ground and water.  Local officials closed the U.S. Highway 10 Bridge that connects Minnesota and Wisconsin near Prescott  WI until approximately 2000 hrs. CST  3/05/08.",
