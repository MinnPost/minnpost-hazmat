The Canadian Pacific Railway & Iowa  Chicago and Eastern Railroad were notified that the IC&E MSPKC-17 train  traveling south on the Canadian Pacific Railways River Subdivision Mainline Track  did indeed have a chemical leak. The train was stopped south of Lake City  MN and the crew was evacuated. Residents in the immediate area were evacuated and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated. As more information from the scene was relayed  forces were dispatched including local fire  emergency management  ambulance  law  IC&E Emergency Responders  CP Emergency Responders  MN Regional Haz-Mat Responders  MN State Responders and contract Haz-Mat responders. The contracted Haz-Mat team was able to seal the anhydrous ammonia tank cars leak  which was found to be coming from the pressure relief valve  with an Emergency Response Midland B Capping Kit. After the leak had been sealed and the area determined to be safe the evacuation was lifted and the area cleared. Tank Car GATX 58261 was set out at the adjacent siding for trans-loading  investigation and repairs. Tran-loading of the remaining product was completed March 20  2007 at 1400 hours. Investigation during the teardown process of the cars relief valve revealed a complete fracture of the valve stem which adjusts and retains the relief pressure valve. In addition  the relieve valves spring  retainer and nuts were observed in the bottom of the car. A new complete certified pressure relief valve was installed on site by Rescar  who was contracted by CF Industries Inc."

The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure  due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site  along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris  Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker  into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20 000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.  The Local Fire Department continued to spray water onto the damaged tank until no further vapors were released.  West Central Environmental Consultants proceeded to recover the contaminated waters from the site.  Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health were on site to monitor the air and ensure safe levels within immediate area.  WCEC pulled soil samples from the adjacent soils in the area  per Minnesota DOT  and site will be monitored to ensure all levels of contamination have been recovered."
