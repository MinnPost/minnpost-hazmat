The farmer was trying to turn into a field approach.    The farm tractor forced the semi and tank off the road and into a ditch.  The tank separated from the semi and rolled over several times.  The semi then went into the ditch and rolled over.      The piping on the discharge side of the pump was torn off and a gasket inside the internal vavle ripped and stuck inside the valve preventing it from closing completely.  Anhydrous released and blew toward the semi where the driver was unconscious.    A water fog was sprayed onto the leaking anhydrous but the cold weather made the release slow until it was barely noticable allowing responders to approach the tank and install a valve on the pump discharg to eliminate the release.",

While traveling  Jensen Transport vehicle was clipped by a train  which caused truck to rollover onto its side and release product.  The capacity of the tanker is 40 000 pounds.  The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure  due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site  along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris  Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker  into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20 000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.  The Local Fire Department continued to spray water onto the damaged tank until no further vapors were released.  West Central Environmental Consultants proceeded to recover the contaminated waters from the site.  Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health were on site to monitor the air and ensure safe levels within immediate area.  WCEC pulled soil samples from the adjacent soils in the area  per Minnesota DOT  and site will be monitored to ensure all levels of contamination have been recovered.",
