While traveling  Jensen Transport vehicle was clipped by a train  which caused truck to rollover onto its side and release product.  The capacity of the tanker is 40 000 pounds.  The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure  due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site  along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris  Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker  into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20 000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.  The Local Fire Department continued to spray water onto the damaged tank until no further vapors were released.  West Central Environmental Consultants proceeded to recover the contaminated waters from the site.  Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health were on site to monitor the air and ensure safe levels within immediate area.  WCEC pulled soil samples from the adjacent soils in the area  per Minnesota DOT  and site will be monitored to ensure all levels of contamination have been recovered."

The immediate supervisor put on a respirator and went in to apply a neutralizer to try and control the spill.  The fumes were still very strong  so the trailer was removed from the building and the fire department was contacted.  Upon arrival at approximately 20:00  the fire department was presented with the Hazardous Materials Shipping Papers for the load  to determine the hazard present.  Infotrac was notified at 20:52 and they contacted the shipper (Seacole) recommending that Bay West Environmental Services be contacted for the clean-up.  Bay West arrived at approximately 01:00 and started the clean-up and the fire department left the scene.  Bay West removed and washed or eliminated any contaminated packages that were in the trailer  then proceeded to wash out the trailer.  The scene was cleared at 05:15."

While rolling the drums onto the pallets  the driver came into contact with some residue on the side of a drum containing phosphoric acid solution.  The driver was wearing gloves at the time.  The material wet the gloves and the calf area of his pants legs.  He washed the affected areas of his skin and contacted the HazMat Department of his company.  He stated that he did not feel any ill effects at the time  and wished to continue on his route.    He called again from his next stop reporting that he feels some burning sensation to the affected areas of his legs.  The Jevic HazMat Department directed him to go to a nearby medical facility for evaluation and possible treatment.  The driver was found by the hospital to have moderate acid burns to legs and thighs."
