Shortly afterwards  a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train's two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07. An overpass (MN State Highway 7) which runs over and is perpendicular to the main track and siding was closed until MN DOT officials inspected this structure for damages."

The officer confirmed the chemical leak as the train passed by and advised his dispatcher to call the railroad. The Canadian Pacific Railway & Iowa  Chicago and Eastern Railroad were notified that the IC&E MSPKC-17 train  traveling south on the Canadian Pacific Railways River Subdivision Mainline Track  did indeed have a chemical leak. The train was stopped south of Lake City  MN and the crew was evacuated. Residents in the immediate area were evacuated and the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated. As more information from the scene was relayed  forces were dispatched including local fire  emergency management  ambulance  law  IC&E Emergency Responders  CP Emergency Responders  MN Regional Haz-Mat Responders  MN State Responders and contract Haz-Mat responders. The contracted Haz-Mat team was able to seal the anhydrous ammonia tank cars leak  which was found to be coming from the pressure relief valve  with an Emergency Response Midland B Capping Kit. After the leak had been sealed and the area determined to be safe the evacuation was lifted and the area cleared. Tank Car GATX 58261 was set out at the adjacent siding for trans-loading  investigation and repairs. Tran-loading of the remaining product was completed March 20  2007 at 1400 hours. Investigation during the teardown process of the cars relief valve revealed a complete fracture of the valve stem which adjusts and retains the relief pressure valve. In addition  the relieve valves spring  retainer and nuts were observed in the bottom of the car. A new complete certified pressure relief valve was installed on site by Rescar  who was contracted by CF Industries Inc."

        "Desc_of_Events": "The vehicle incurred a right side  steer tire failure.  The XATA crash data report indicates that the driver immediately removed his foot from the throttle and applied his brakes.  As the vehicle decelerated  the application of the brakes caused the vehicle to move to the right-side off the highway  crossing the paved shoulder on to the slope of a drainage ditch that tilted the vehicle beyond its center of gravity causing it to rollover coming to rest on the drivers side.    Three (3) ammonium nitrate bin lids were torn off during the roll  even though they were securely locked.  The driver was seat belted properly during the crash  and subsequently was able to climb out of the passengers side of the vehicle.  9-1-1 was notified  and subsequently the drivers terminal manager was notified of the incident.  The drivers terminal manager notified the company  which notified ERTS  the companys 24-hr spill consultant who dispatched Wench Associates  a qualified spill contractor to the scene.
