While traveling  Jensen Transport vehicle was clipped by a train  which caused truck to rollover onto its side and release product.  The capacity of the tanker is 40 000 pounds.  The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure  due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site  along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris  Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker  into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20 000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.  The Local Fire Department continued to spray water onto the damaged tank until no further vapors were released.  West Central Environmental Consultants proceeded to recover the contaminated waters from the site.  Center for Toxicology and Environmental Health were on site to monitor the air and ensure safe levels within immediate area.  WCEC pulled soil samples from the adjacent soils in the area  per Minnesota DOT  and site will be monitored to ensure all levels of contamination have been recovered."

Shortly afterwards  a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train's two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07. An overpass (MN State Highway 7) which runs over and is perpendicular to the main track and siding was closed until MN DOT officials inspected this structure for damages."
