BNSF investigation of car movement records of CRDX 6046 revealed that in transit CRDX 6046 was stopped in Dilworth  MN on 11/17/2011 with a bottom outlet mechanical problem. Local mechanical responders reportedly wired closed a partially open bottom hopper outlet on 11/21/2011. A small amount of product spillage under CRDX 6046 was shoveled  followed by local disposal.   After the aforementioned 12/15/2011 notification  a response contractor was requested to have a vacuum truck go to Dilworth railyard and locations entering the railyard to vacuum up any product spillage found (later reporting that an estimated 3000 lbs. was vacuumed). This captured material was earmarked for appropriate disposal. Also  BNSF mechanical personnel were requested to inspect CRDX 6046 at its Decker  MT location and report on the operation of its bottom outlets. Inspection revealed that number 1 and 4 bottom outlet door gate systems would not close properly to securely lock shut due to capstans needing replacement and door gates out of adjustment.  CRDX 6046 was directed to a repair facility after the consignee unloaded and released it."

The XATA crash data report indicates that the driver immediately removed his foot from the throttle and applied his brakes.  As the vehicle decelerated  the application of the brakes caused the vehicle to move to the right-side off the highway  crossing the paved shoulder on to the slope of a drainage ditch that tilted the vehicle beyond its center of gravity causing it to rollover coming to rest on the drivers side.    Three (3) ammonium nitrate bin lids were torn off during the roll  even though they were securely locked.  The driver was seat belted properly during the crash  and subsequently was able to climb out of the passengers side of the vehicle.  9-1-1 was notified  and subsequently the drivers terminal manager was notified of the incident.  The drivers terminal manager notified the company  which notified ERTS  the companys 24-hr spill consultant who dispatched Wench Associates  a qualified spill contractor to the scene.  ERTS called the National Response Center at 4:00 PM as required by the HMR.    The release occurred at 3:24 PM EST and the recovery was concluded at approximately 9:00 PM EST.  Wench Associates contained and cleaned up the spill working in coordination with State Highway officials and Local First Responders."
