Subsequently  Ms. offered the same box on FX airbill 863904300141. There was no indication that the package contained any dangerous goods. Ms.  used the same drop box as the previous shipment. We opened the box to reveal the same contents as the previous evening. There were no markings  labeling  emergency response info nor other external indicators to lead us to believe the contents were regulated. I called the FAA in MSP and spoke to SA Joe Sanders. Subsequently I spoke to Betty from the shipper's legal dept who indicated both have been trained to ship dangerous goods."
