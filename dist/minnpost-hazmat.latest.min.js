BNSF investigation of car movement records of CRDX 6046 revealed that in transit CRDX 6046 was stopped in Dilworth  MN on 11/17/2011 with a bottom outlet mechanical problem. Local mechanical responders reportedly wired closed a partially open bottom hopper outlet on 11/21/2011. A small amount of product spillage under CRDX 6046 was shoveled  followed by local disposal.   After the aforementioned 12/15/2011 notification  a response contractor was requested to have a vacuum truck go to Dilworth railyard and locations entering the railyard to vacuum up any product spillage found (later reporting that an estimated 3000 lbs. was vacuumed). This captured material was earmarked for appropriate disposal. Also  BNSF mechanical personnel were requested to inspect CRDX 6046 at its Decker  MT location and report on the operation of its bottom outlets. Inspection revealed that number 1 and 4 bottom outlet door gate systems would not close properly to securely lock shut due to capstans needing replacement and door gates out of adjustment.  CRDX 6046 was directed to a repair facility after the consignee unloaded and released it."\n    }, \n    {\n        "Explosion_Result_Ind": "No", \n        "Tot_Hazmat_Fatal": 0.0, \n        "Dest_State": null, \n        "Inc_Zip": "55008", \n        "Rpt_Num": "I-2007010319", \n        "Tot_Hazmat_Inj": 0.0, \n        "Unit_of_Measure": "LGA", \n        "grouped_Commod_Long_Name": "ALCOHOLS  N.O.S.", \n        "Spill_Result_Ind": "Yes", \n        "Orig_Zip": "57002", \n        "Time_Inc": "2030", \n        "Gas_Dispersion_Result_Ind": "Yes", \n        "Fire_Result_Ind": "No", \n        "Inc_St": "MN", \n        "Mode_Transpo": "Rail", \n        "Date_Inc": "2006-11-22", \n        "Dest_City": null, \n        "Orig_State": "SOUTH DAKOTA", \n        "Orig_City": "AURORA", \n        "Inc_City": "CAMBRIDGE", \n        "Tot_Amt_of_Damages": 436369.0, \n        "Dest_Zip": null, \n        "What_Failed_Desc": null, \n        "grouped_Ship_Name": "VERASUN ENERBY", \n        "grouped_C_R_Name": "DAKOTA  MINNESOTA & EASTERN RAILROAD CORPORATION", \n        "How_Failed_Desc": null, \n        "No_Release_Result_Ind": "No", \n        "Tot_Evac": 12.0, \n        "Quant_Released": 24877.0, \n        "Desc_of_Events": "DAKOTA  MINNESOTA & EASTERN RAILROD TRAIN #EAUCC-22 WAS EASTBOUND AT A RECORDED SPEED OF 24 MPH AT MILEPOST 157.75 WHEN IT ENCOUNTERED BROKEN RAIL.

Shortly afterwards  a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train\'s two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07.

While traveling  Jensen Transport vehicle was clipped by a train  which caused truck to rollover onto its side and release product.  The capacity of the tanker is 40 000 pounds.  The Local Fire Department responded to apply water to the overturned tanker and reduce vapor cloud emitting from the cargo tank.  Immediate area was evacuated as a precautionary measure  due to the heavy vapors.  Swift County Emergency Management Agency and Chemical Assessment Team responded to assess the site  along with the Minnesota Department of Agriculture.  West Central Environmental Consultants of Morris  Minnesota was dispatched to assist in cleanup.  Burlington Northern Sante Fe Railyard contracted Specialized Response Solutions (SRS) to transfer product from the damaged tanker  into a rescue tanker provided by Jensen Transport.   Approximately 20 000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia were recovered into the rescue tanker.

Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07.

Shortly afterwards  a BNSF northbound train on the main track struck the rail equipment fouling the single main track which resulted in the derailment of the northbound train\'s two locomotive units and its head 22 railcars. Included in this derailment of the northbound train was UCLX 30002 (DOT 111A100W5 tank car) that came to rest in a slanted upright position atop other derailed rail equipment and sustained several breaches to its tank car shell. The B-end head sustained a large dent in the upper left head quadrant with a large peel tear in the head metal which allowed a large volume of product to escape. Also in the B-end head were two one inch puncture holes within the lower right head quadrant. The A-end side shell sustained a 3 inch by 3 inch puncture hole as well. It was estimated that the majority of the commodity within UCLX 30002 was lost. UCLX 30002 was cleaned and purged on site. BNSF contract responders applied lime to the ground spillage to neutralize the acid spill. Neutralized impacted soil was later excavated and staged for appropriate disposal.  Approximately 350 to 400 residents in the southwest portion of Clara City were evacuated. The evacuation ended at 1600 hrs. CDT  10/29/07.
